                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Is commonly referred to as "Xander," is the bassist of The Holistic Approach.
                        <br>
Born on November 2, 2001, in Baltimore, Maryland, Xander spent much of his childhood in suburban Connecticut.  He originally grew up wanting to be a cartoonist and excelled in art classes as a child. He immediatelyunderstood that creativity and passion go hand-in-hand.
<br>
<br>
In my own words:
<br>
"Life has been tough for me.  A lot of small little hardships seemed to get me down more than the more traumatic stuff.  Inner demons keep fighting each other.  I never felt happy.  I thought I was going to die, without leaving anything memorable behind or making a difference.  Sometimes  daydreaming of what I could create was the only solace, and even today, it still feels that way."
<br>
<br>
Music gradually became something of a comfort object for the teenaged Jackson, who would frequently listen to it whenever he could.  His music taste gradually got more diverse, and today spans everything from Nirvana to Eminem to The Offspring to Knife Party.  The common theme for Xander became loud, dark, but nonetheless melodic music.  His primary influences include Rage Against the Machine, Blink-182, Fall Out Boy, Neck Deep, The Birthday Massacre, Alice in Chains, Waterparks, Metallica, Tool, and Bring me the Horizon.
After moving to London in 2020 due to familial concerns and disillusionment of the United States, Jackson's musical passions were shelved as he struggled to feel comfortably in an unfamiliar country.  After two bad job experiences in a row, Jackson began to take music more seriously after remembering the last time he felt truly happy was at a Waterparks concert.  
<br>
<br>
By channeling his anger, depression, and happiness into songwriting, Evans began pumping out songs like hotcakes, and joined the Holistic Approach via social media to continue his musical journey full-time.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            John (Real Name Savescu Octavian Ioan) was born in 1991 on the 5th of May in the small town of Targu-Jiu /  County - Gorj in Romania to his Orthodox Christian parents Maria and Aurelian from whom he was given his Saint Name - Ioan ( Middle Name)  ioan is Saint John in the King James Bible.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Growing up in a poor family as Romania was just coming out of communism the journey of his life up to this point was full of ups and downs / dark and light/hopes and disappointments, but his stubborn nature and his character never allowed him to back down from moving forwards. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In his own words: 
                            <br>
                            "Sitting Down" would only have kept me stuck in that place of discomfort 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Music and films have always allowed me to dream and dream big; see and understand the world through the eyes of others and experience more than my environment could have ever offered.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I used to struggle to get up in the morning for school as I was staying up late to watch on my old TubeTv black and white American/English movies and musicals. Beautiful stories, of struggle, passion, love, loss and hope. Stories of one's destiny and the journey of a lifetime.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            At the beginning music was only the escape room where the world would stop... and everything around me felt like when you submerge yourself in a hot bath and sit there, still, in the silence of the moment as the warmth is surrounding every inch of your being and time is no longer a factor of existence itself.
                            It has slowly become a day-to-day requirement, a total disconnect, a place of balance, a place of hope and power."
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Just to name a couple of bands that have made an impact in the young mind of the singer are:
                            Metalica, Seether, Within Temptations, Dream Theatre, Stone Sour, Guns and Roses, Bullet for My Valentine, Nirvana, Aerosmith, Three Doors Down, Green Day and many more.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After his parents split up around the age of 14 and his father passed away a couple of years later, John had to take life into his own hands and find ways to break free from the clutches of a poor educational system, and a lack of financial stability which he used to fuel his passion for his musical expression.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Playing in a couple of local bands throughout the years and working on his vocal technique and starting to learn music from the bottom up were just the stepping stones to discovering the artist from within.
                            These steps were required for the long journey of expression and self-discovery, steps that fueled the hopes and dreams of a better world and a better outcome, all presented to him at a very young age
                            A story, a fairytale, where the imagination comes to life.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            With some Divine intervention and the help of some beautiful people, in  2014 after he graduated from the University of Spiru Haret Bucharest he was presented with the opportunity to relocate to England / London, an opportunity that he took in a heartbeat.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After many years of struggling and hard work to gain some financial stability,  he has managed to fulfil a part of his childhood dream. By obtaining his British Citizenship he has moved one step closer to the fantasy becoming reality.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As the main boxes were ticked it was about time that John jumped back on the Horse to find a group of like-minded people, creative people with whom he could start navigating the magical realms fantasy and storytelling.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            And through the wonderful invention of social media he got in contact with the founder of the band The Hollistic Approach and here we are today!

                                <span class="modal-band-member-title">Alejandro Robinson </span>
                            <br>
                            Born 8th June 1999, is the lead guitarist of the punk band Holistic Approach. Growing up in Worcester Park rock music was not a prevalent as other genres, but thanks to Alejandro’s cousin’s love of the punk bands Busted and McFly, this opened the door to Alejandro discovering his love for not only rock music but playing the guitar. At age 12 he started guitar lessons at his secondary school and immediately was eager to learn all the essential knowledge to create his very own type of music. Once Alejandro finished high school he was determined to pursue his music journey and decided to form his first punk band FlipSwitch. The band managed to play a few gigs around London and even began recording an EP, however personal issues with the bandmates lead to the split of the band 3 years later. After the split Alejandro decided to enrol at ACM (Academy of Contemporary Music) university, where he discovered a wide range of guitar techniques and music theory which elevated his guitar playing; the primary reason being Alejandro discovering the power metal band DragonForce.
                            <br>
                            With all this new knowledge Alejandro decided it was time to make his very own band with students he met at his university, however struggled to find people who were 100% committed to the band and the music. However, thanks to the app Vampr, he was able to find people such as John Savescu (vocalist) and Xander (bassist). In his line of work Alejandro managed to find the drummer Matt Curry, who previously played for numerous bands ranging from prog to metal. When it came to finding a rhythm guitarist Alejandro managed to get in contact with one his closest friends from his home town and asked whether his older brother would be interested in joining the band and he said yes without a second thought. After the bands first rehearsal they all knew the band had finally formed and decided to name themselves Holistic Approach.
